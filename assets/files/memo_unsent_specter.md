It’s still decaying. You know it. All of you.

This machine we built is dying under its own weight, and no one sees it — or worse, they do and choose silence. I won’t. Not anymore.

I’ve left the tool where you’ll find it, eventually. If you’re reading this, you’re close.

They’ll deny me again, but you can finish it.
