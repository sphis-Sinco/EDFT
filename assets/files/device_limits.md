[CONFIDENTIAL][EDF-T02] INTERNAL MEMO: RESTRICTED DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOLS

Subject: Regulation of Device and Machine Manufacturing within EDF Programs  
Classification: ULTRA-RESTRICTED | Clearance Level: ADMIN+

Overview:  
Due to escalating concerns regarding unauthorized creation and deployment of experimental devices and machinery, EDF Command has enacted new protocols restricting development privileges. Effective immediately, only personnel with verified licenses or projects bearing explicit government seals of approval may initiate or authorize manufacturing.

Rationale:  
Unregulated production of advanced technologies poses severe security risks, including potential leaks, misuse, or sabotage. By limiting manufacturing rights, EDF aims to:

- Ensure accountability and traceability in all development phases  
- Prevent unauthorized technology dissemination  
- Maintain project integrity aligned with strategic objectives  

Implementation:  
- All device and machine design requests must be submitted through the Official Development Clearance System (ODCS).  
- Licenses will be granted exclusively to personnel vetted by the Security Oversight Council (SOC).  
- Project approval seals will be digitally embedded in all authorized designs and manufacturing instructions.  
- Systems detecting unlicensed or unsigned manufacturing attempts will trigger immediate lockdown and security protocols.

Personnel Impact:  
This policy supersedes prior decentralized development models. All developers, engineers, and contractors must comply or face revocation of development privileges and potential disciplinary action.

Further directives and access to the ODCS portal will be communicated to authorized personnel. Any attempts to circumvent these protocols will be met with strict enforcement measures.
