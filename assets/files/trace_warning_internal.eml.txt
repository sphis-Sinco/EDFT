SUBJECT: URGENT: Block trace entrypoint

We've located fragments of Specter's trace protocol still embedded in subsystems. If this command is executed, we will lose containment.

Do NOT underestimate Specter. This isn’t a prank. This isn’t folklore.

Kill the hook. Kill the path. If someone runs that command, it’s over.
