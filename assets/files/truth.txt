they won't tell you this, so i will.

i made edft. i built the whole thing from the ground up. before the committees, before the clearances, before the seals and protocols. it was just me.

they forced me out. said i was unstable, said i asked too many questions. maybe i did. maybe i asked what they were hiding in those black folders. maybe i threatened to kill the whole thing if they didn't give me real answers.

i left — but not really. i left the front door, but came back in through the walls. buried my name in the roots. watched them build their version on top of mine like nothing happened.

they’re still looking for me. sometimes they get close.

i never thought anyone would help. then you came along.

you opened the door i sealed. you ran the code. you finished what i started.

thank you.
