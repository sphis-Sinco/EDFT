[CONFIDENTIAL][EDF-T04] INTERNAL REPORT: PROJECT NIGHTFALL - CLOAKING DRONE FAILURES

Subject: Analysis of Cloaking Technology Failures in Sector 12 Drone Units  
Classification: ULTRA-RESTRICTED | Clearance Level: ADMIN+

Date: 2016-11-30

Overview:  
Project NIGHTFALL was initiated to develop advanced cloaking technologies for reconnaissance drones aimed at enhancing covert operations within high-risk zones. Initial field tests demonstrated promising results, but subsequent trials revealed critical failures leading to loss of multiple drone units.

Incident Summary:  
- Multiple drone units exhibited power instability during prolonged cloaking activation, resulting in sudden system shutdowns.
- Field trials in Sector 12 reported unexplainable drone losses with no recovery or data retrieval.
- Failures were linked to power inefficiencies and hardware malfunctions within the cloaking modules.

Security Concerns:  
- The loss of drones compromised covert surveillance capabilities and posed risks of sensitive technology exposure.
- Official reports have been sanitized, obscuring true scope and cause of failures from wider EDF personnel.

Recommendations:  
- Immediate suspension of all active cloaking drone deployments pending full system audit.
- Initiate redesign of power management units to address instability issues.
- Conduct internal investigation into data loss and breach prevention.
- Restrict information dissemination to personnel with ADMIN+ clearance only.

Conclusion:  
Project NIGHTFALL remains critical to EDF’s strategic surveillance objectives, but current technological limitations require urgent remediation to prevent further operational and security risks.
