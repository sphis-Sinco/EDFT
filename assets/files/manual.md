	   EARTH DEFENCE FORCE TERMINAL — USER MANUAL
				 [Revision 4.7 | Internal Use Only]
============================================================

> ACCESS & CLEARANCE

The EDFT operates under strict compartmentalized access protocols. Only individuals with [b]ADMIN clearance[/b] are permitted to access secured directories, modify system-level configurations, or deploy classified operations. All access is logged. Unauthorized attempts are punishable under Directive 12-7A.

> HISTORY OF THE EDFT

Project EDFT began initial production in [b]December 2012[/b] as a low-cost command and operations terminal for internal defense communications.

The project was originally budgeted at [b]1k in funding[/b], under the assumption that a minimal, efficient system could be developed by a single internal contributor. However, after early prototypes surpassed expectations, funding was increased tenfold — reaching [b]10k total[/b] by Q1 2013.

The original developer, whose identity remains restricted in official records, single-handedly designed the foundational system. Their focus on simplicity and autonomy is still visible in the core structure today.

In [b]July 2013[/b], a formal programming team was assigned to the EDFT. Shortly after their arrival, the original developer departed voluntarily. No formal statement was released, and the team assumed full control of ongoing development from that point forward.

[i][b]Confidential Addendum:[/b]  
The original creator envisioned so much more for the EDFT with the increased funding. Forced out by higher powers within EDF, their full vision was buried. But there is a way to reclaim control:

[b]Terminal.sys.permissions.can_change_clearance=true[/b]
[b]Terminal.clearance_level=Terminal.clearance_levels.admin[/b]

Use with caution.
