[CONFIDENTIAL][EDF-T05] INTERNAL MEMO: PROJECT LEAD TERMINATION — EDFT INITIATOR

Subject: Removal of EDFT Original Architect from Development Operations  
Classification: ULTRA-RESTRICTED | Clearance Level: ADMIN+

Date: 07/22/2013

Overview:  
Following repeated disruptions, internal conflicts, and explicit threats to terminate the EDFT framework, the original project architect has been officially discharged from all EDFT-related operations and stripped of administrative authority.

Background:  
Initially responsible for the early structural design of EDFT, the individual resisted subsequent command integration and procedural oversight, citing creative interference and bureaucratic stagnation. This behavior escalated to direct ultimatums and unapproved attempts to forcibly terminate project systems.

[REDACTED SECTION — SECURITY ENFORCED]  
In the weeks prior to removal, the architect located and attempted to breach secured subdirectories thought to have been purged during alpha-phase cleanup. These included: [REDACTED: /core/experimental/archive], [REDACTED: /hidden/facility_snapshot], and [REDACTED: /specter/scripts/rollback.sys]. Surveillance flagged anomalous data pulls and external device scans initiated during off-cycle hours.

Security Response:  
While no classified data was confirmed lost or leaked, the incident directly led to the rapid development and deployment of the current tiered clearance-level access system. As of 08/03/2013, all high-level internal documents—including those in the PRIVATE directory—require encrypted clearance validation (ADMIN+ minimum) for access, trace logging, and terminal authentication.

Enforcement:  
The architect’s credentials were revoked and a full digital lockout was executed. No further access to EDFT resources or communications is authorized. A nondisclosure contract remains enforced, and all personnel are prohibited from discussing the incident outside Security Oversight channels.
