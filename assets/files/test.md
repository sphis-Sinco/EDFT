Hello world

This is a test on the [b]official EDFT.[/b] 2013 is going to be a good year since its been funded since production started in December of 2012. I\'ve been trying to make it the best terminal for the government to use.

The inital funding of 1k was enough but [b]they gave 10k![/b] They really are interested in the project and I LOVE it.

I made sure it was simple so that I would only need the 1k but now [b]I feel so much freedom.[/b]

Update from 2013. They introduced their own programming team into the project and [i]I\'ve felt so limited,[/i] ironic am I right? I can\'t implement most of the things I\'ve wanted like folders, so sorry, only the home directory, but I\'m sure I can convince them to add it later... right?

2013 Update 2 months later, it\'s June, [b]no.[/b] They\'ve denied folders for some stupid reason? Saying that "it\'s too complicated for something that won\'t be used much", I\'m crushed. I don\'t think I want to be assosiated with this project anymore. I can kinda see what the 10k was for, [i]they planned the whole team thing... didn\'t they?[/i]'
